IPL Project Report

1. Introduction
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and competitive T20 cricket leagues globally. Cricket fans worldwide eagerly anticipate the Indian Premier League each year, which has grown into one of the most popular and prestigious T20 cricket leagues globally. The IPL brings together top-notch cricketers from various countries, making it a highly competitive tournament. 
In this project, we will analyze the batting and bowling performances of players across different IPL seasons. we conduct a comprehensive analysis of player performance based on batting and bowling data, aiming to gain valuable insights and recommend the best players for each position in a cricket team. The analysis includes visualizations, statistics, and player recommendations for forming a cricket team.
2. Data Loading
We started by loading the batting and bowling datasets for different IPL seasons. The data was read from CSV files and converted into structured data for further analysis.
To ensure accurate and reliable results, we started by collecting historical IPL data from reputable sources such as Kaggle and cricket databases. The datasets encompassed detailed statistics of players batting and bowling performances, including metrics like runs scored, strike rate, batting average, wickets taken, economy rate, and more. 
3. Data Cleaning
The initial step in the analysis involved data preprocessing to clean, format, and transform the raw data. Various preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. The data was standardized and normalized as required to ensure fair comparisons between players
The data was preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant entries, and the necessary Python libraries were used to read and manipulate the data effectively.
•	Replacing Dash with 0 in Batting "Avg" column: In the batting data, we replaced the dash  ("-") with 0 to handle missing values in the batting average column.
•	Replacing Star with Space in Batting "HS" column: In the batting data, we replaced the star    ("*") with (“  ”) to handle missing values in the Highest Score(HS) column.
•	Removing Unnecessary Columns: We removed irrelevant columns like "pos," "BBI," and "POS" from the batting and bowling datasets.
•	Combining Data Across Seasons: We combined batting and bowling data across different seasons for each player to obtain cumulative statistics.
•	Formatting Bowling Data: We calculated and formatted the average, economy rate, and strike rate for bowlers across different seasons.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase of any data analysis project, as it helps us comprehend the data and extract meaningful insights.
In this section, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Summary statistics and data visualizations, such as graphs and charts, were used to understand the distribution of key variables. The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the players' performances in previous IPL seasons.
The dataset consists of detailed player information, such as their name, team, batting stats (runs, strike rate, average, 100s, 50s, 4s, 6s), and bowling stats (wickets, economy, average, 4-wicket hauls, 5-wicket hauls).
1.	Bar graphs: Used to visualize players with the strike rate, batting average, and the runs, centuries, half-centuries, fours, and sixes. These visualizations provided a clear understanding of the players performance in different categories.
2.	Pie charts: Depicting players with the most runs, centuries, half-centuries, four, sixes, wickets and 4-wicket/5-wicket hauls.
3.	Scatter plots: Utilized to explore the relationship between strike rate and batting average. This helped us identify trends and patterns that could indicate players consistency and effectiveness.
4.	Histograms: Employed to understand the distribution of player performances in terms of runs scored and wickets taken. The histograms helped identify outliers and players with exceptional performances.
